				<p class="description">As I mentioned before, I'm a graphic design student! Creating things has always been a big part of my life, and that's one of the many reasons why I wanted to become a graphic designer. My favorite things to create would have to be illustrations and character art, but I also enjoy typography and photography. Whenever I have time to myself, I love to spend time with my cats, play video games like Devil May Cry, Overwatch 2, and Marvel Rivals, or catch up on my favorite shows!<br>Throughout my education, I've always had at least one creative class. In middle school, I took part in a gifted arts class for some time, and then in high school, I discovered my passion for graphic design and photography in my yearbook classes. While I'm at NMSU-A, I took a few introductory courses in Adobe Photograph, Illustrator, and InDesign to have more knowledge and experience with graphic design.</p>
